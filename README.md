# ðŸ§© Rubik's Race Solver

This project was created for the CS246 Artificial Intelligence course at the American University of Armenia.

The goal is to solve the puzzle from the board game Rubikâ€™s Race using classical AI search algorithms and compare their performance on scrambled puzzles of different difficulty levels.


## What This Project Does

- Represents the Rubikâ€™s Race board as a 5x5 grid.
- Defines a goal region (the center 3Ã—3 part of the board).
- Randomly scrambles the board by a certain number of valid moves.
- Tries to solve the puzzle using four search algorithms:
  - **A*** (A-Star Search)
  - **IDA*** (Iterative Deepening A-Star)
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Hill Climbing** (a local search method)

Each algorithm is compared based on:
- Whether it finds a solution.
- How many nodes it expands to reach the goal.

## How to Run

### 1. Install requirements

Only one external library is needed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 2. Run a single puzzle test

To generate a random puzzle and solve it using all algorithms:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Run the experiment

To reproduce the experiments described in the paper:

```bash
python experiment.py
```

This will:

- Run the algorithms on puzzles scrambled with different difficulty levels.

- Record the number of nodes expanded.

- Save the results to a CSV file called `experiment_results.csv`.

You can change how many puzzles to run and how difficult they are by modifying values in the script.


## About the Puzzle

Rubikâ€™s Race is a sliding tile puzzle played on a 5Ã—5 grid. One tile space is blank (`_`) and tiles can slide into it. The goal is to move tiles so that the center 3Ã—3 window matches a target goal pattern.

This project treats it like a variation of the **N-Puzzle** and applies search algorithms to find a solution path from the scrambled board back to the goal.



## Experiment Summary

The `rubiks-race-solver-analysis.pdf` file included in this repository contains the full experimental results and analysis.

### Key Findings

- **IDA\*** with both **Manhattan Distance** and **Number of Misplaced Tiles** heuristics is the most efficient algorithm, expanding the fewest nodes overall.
- **BFS** works but is highly inefficient, expanding thousands of nodes.
- **Hill Climbing** is fast when it succeeds, but often fails due to local minima.
- **A\*** finds optimal paths but uses more memory and expands more nodes compared to IDA\*.
- The **distance from the goal** (i.e. number of scrambling steps) affects puzzle difficulty more than the board size itself.
